New maintainer(s) wanted
========================

We (the current maintainers) lack the time and energy to maintain apt-mirror:
Our last commit is years old and the number of pull request is rising. We
agreed on acknowledging this fact and are searching for new maintainers who
wants to join the GitHub apt-mirror group and continue maintaining this
repository and do new releases. If you are interested and have time and energy
to take the project over, please contact Brandon Holtsclaw to give you the
permission.
